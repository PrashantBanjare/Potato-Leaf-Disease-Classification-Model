# Potato Leaf Disease Classifier 

 - This project is a Potato Leaf Disease Classification System built using Python, TensorFlow, and deep learning techniques.
 - It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify potato leaf images into categories such as Healthy, Early Blight, and Late Blight based on visual symptoms.

## Features

- Image data loading and preprocessing (resizing, normalization, training/validation split)
- Label mapping for multi-class classification (Healthy, Early Blight, Late Blight)
- Construction of a custom CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras
- Model training with loss and accuracy tracking
- Visualization of training and validation curves
- Prediction function to classify new potato leaf images
- Model saving using model.save() for future deployment

## Dataset
- The model is trained on a labeled dataset of potato leaf images sourced from open datasets such as PlantVillage. Each image belongs to one of the following classes:
- Healthy 
- Early Blight
- Late Blight
